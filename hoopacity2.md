# Hoopa City 2 Building Guide

Lots of options on this game by Dr Panda, but it can be a pain to figure what you need to build each structure. 

* Heart: builds a house
* Graduation cap: builds a Dr. Panda statue
* Road: builds a road
* Balloons: build a playground
* Leaf: builds a patch of flowers
* Water: builds a puddle of water
* Coin: builds a cafe
* Electricity: builds a wind turbine

The shovel on the far left is used to remove items and buildings from the land.

When combining materials,  keep in mind that the sequence matters. For example, heart plus coin makes a bank, but coin plus heart doesn't yield anything.

## HEART
On its own, a heart makes a house. But when combined with other elements, a heart can make the following things:

* Apartment building = 4 hearts in a 2×2 grid
* Bank = heart + coin
* City hall = heart + heart
* Fire station = heart + heart + water
* Hospital = heart + heart + graduation cap
* Library = heart + graduation cap
* Skyscraper = 4 hearts in a 2×2 grid + coin
* Police station = heart + heart + heart
* Museum = 4 libraries (heart + graduation cap) in a 2×2 grid

## GRADUATION CAP
On its own, a graduation cap makes a Dr. Panda statue. When combined with other materials, a graduation cap makes the following things:

* Fountain = graduation cap + water
* School = graduation cap + heart
* Music school = graduation cap + balloons
* College = graduation cap + heart + graduation cap
* University = 4 colleges (graduation cap + heart + graduation cap) in a 2×2 grid
* Observatory = graduation cap + graduation cap

## ROAD
You can make the following things when you combine a road with other materials:

* Airport = 6 roads in a 3×2 grid + coin
* Bus stop = road + heart
* Avenue = road + leaf
* Railroad = road + electricity
* Train crossing = road + electricity + road
* Underwater railroad tunnel = road + electricity + water
* Train station = road + electricity + heart
* Underwater tunnel = road + water

## BALLOONS
Balloons are used to make entertainment-related buildings. You can make the following things:

* Movie theater = balloons + coin
* Stadium = balloons + road
* Skate park = balloons + balloons
* Swimming pool = balloons + water

## LEAF
On its own, a leaf makes a patch of flowers. You can combine other materials with leaf to create the following things:

* Flower shop = leaf + electricity
* Hill = leaf + leaf
* Trees = leaf + water
* Park = leaf + road
* Tree house = leaf + water + balloons
* Saw mill = leaf + water + electricity
* Farm = 4 flower shops (leaf + electricity) in a 2×2 grid

## WATER
Water can be combined with other materials to create the following items:

* Over-water road = water + road
* Over-water railroad = water + road + electricity
* Bridge = 3 × over-water road (water + road)
* Railroad bridge = 3 × over-water railroad (water + road + electricity)
* Fishing pier = water + balloons
* Oil platform = water + electricity

## COIN
On its own, a coin makes a cafe. Combined with other materials, a coin can make these buildings:

* Bicycle shop = coin + road
* Coffee house = coin + balloons
* Supermarket = coin + coin
* Ice cream parlor = coin + coin + balloons
* Restaurant = 4 supermarkets (coin + coin) in a 2×2 grid
* Marketplace = 4 coins in a 2×2 grid
* Sushi place = coin + balloons + graduation cap
* Gas station = coin + road + electricity

## ELECTRICITY
Electricity can be combined with other materials to create the following items:

* Factory = electricity + coin
* Nuclear power plant = 4 electricity in a 2×2 grid
* Solar power plant = electricity + electricity
* Water turbine = electricity + water
