# Hoopa City 2 Building Guide

Lots of options on this game by Dr Panda, but it can be a pain to figure what you need to build each structure. 

Icon | Description
-- | --
❤️  Heart | builds a house
🎓 Graduation cap | builds a Dr. Panda statue
🛣️ Road | builds a road
🎈 Balloons | build a playground
☘️ Leaf | builds a patch of flowers
💧 Water | builds a puddle of water
🪙 Coin | builds a cafe
⚡️ Electricity | builds a wind turbine

The shovel on the far left is used to remove items and buildings from the land.

When combining materials,  keep in mind that the sequence matters. For example, heart plus coin makes a bank, but coin plus heart doesn't yield anything.
